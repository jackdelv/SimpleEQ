# SimpleEQ
Using the JUCE framework I built a 3 band equalizer with a spectrum analyzer. A response curve shows the lowpass, highpass, and peak parameter's effects
on the audio being played.

There are toggle buttons to turn off the spectrum analyzer, lowcut and highcut filters, and the peak filter. Each toggle button also changes the display of 
its sliders.

This project was created following the tutorials from <a href=https://www.programmingformusicians.com/simpleeq/>MatKatMusic</a>.
